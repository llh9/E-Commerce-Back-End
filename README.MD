# E-Commerce-Back-End

    
### [Description](#description)
    
For this project I was given the task to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code and configure a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.
    
### [Motivation](#Motivation)

The motivation behind this project comes from e-commerce being the largest sector of the electronics industry, and the need for me as a developer to understand the fundamental architecture of platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce who provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes.
     
### [Problems Solved](#Motivation)
One of the most problematic issues I encountered involved finding the correct syntax to perform the POST and PUT Methods. The  sequelize documentation was very useful in providing the information that I needed to implement the features of this application.
    
### [What I learned](#Motivation)
From completing this assignment I have learned how to use MySQL Databases, Sequelize, and Express together to send data to and from a client application and server database that implements Object Relational Mapping of the data it stores.
